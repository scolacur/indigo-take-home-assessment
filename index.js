// Create an index.js file with JavaScript that can:
	// Validate data entry
		// Age is required
		// Age must be > 0
		// Relationship is required
	// Add people to a growing household list
	// Reset the entry form after each addition
	// Remove a previously added person from the list
	// Display the household list in the HTML as it is modified
	// Serialize the household as JSON upon form submission as a fake trip to the server
	// Follow industry accessibility guidelines for form validation

// Clarifications
	// Do not modify the given index.html file in any way. You're still allowed to modify the DOM through JavaScript.
	// You must write JavaScript, not a language that compiles down to JavaScript. You must only use features from the ES5 standard. No
	// 3rd party libraries (i.e. no jQuery, no React).
	// The display of the household list is up to you.
	// On submission, put the serialized JSON in the provided <pre class="debug"> DOM element and display that element.
	// After submission, the user should be able to make changes and submit the household again.
	// You don't need to add validations around anything other than the age and relationship requirements described above. It's ok for
	// someone to add 35 parents.
	// The focus here is on the quality of your JavaScript, not the beauty of your design. The controls you add around viewing and
	// deleting household members should be usable but donâ€™t need to look pretty.


//IIFE to prevent polluting global scope
(function() {
	if (!document) return

	//Initialize Application state
	var state = {
		household: []
	}
